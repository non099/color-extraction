color-extraction.py
============
**color-extraction by using colorgram.py**

Installation
------------
You can install colorgram.py with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/>`__, as following:

::

    pip install colorgram.py

How to use
----------

Using colorgram.py is simple. Mainly there's only one function you'll need to use - ``colorgram.extract``.

Example
'''''''

.. code:: python

    import colorgram

    # Extract 6 colors from an image.
    colors = colorgram.extract('sweet_pic.jpg', 6)

    # colorgram.extract returns Color objects, which let you access
    # RGB, HSL, and what proportion of the image was that color.
    first_color = colors[0]
    rgb = first_color.rgb # e.g. (255, 151, 210)
    hsl = first_color.hsl # e.g. (230, 255, 203)
    proportion  = first_color.proportion # e.g. 0.34

    # RGB and HSL are named tuples, so values can be accessed as properties.
    # These all work just as well:
    red = rgb[0]
    red = rgb.r
    saturation = hsl[1]
    saturation = hsl.s

``colorgram.extract(image, number_of_colors)``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Extract colors from an image. ``image`` may be either a path to a file, a file-like object, or a Pillow ``Image`` object. The function will return a list of ``number_of_colors`` ``Color`` objects.

``colorgram.Color``
'''''''''''''''''''
A color extracted from an image. Its properties are:

* ``Color.rgb`` - The color represented as a ``namedtuple`` of RGB from 0 to 255, e.g. ``(r=255, g=151, b=210)``.
* ``Color.hsl`` - The color represented as a ``namedtuple`` of HSL from 0 to 255, e.g. ``(h=230, s=255, l=203)``.
* ``Color.proportion`` - The proportion of the image that is in the extracted color from 0 to 1, e.g. ``0.34``.

Sorting by HSL
''''''''''''''
Something the original library lets you do is sort the colors you get by HSL. In actuality, though, the colors are only sorted by hue (as of colorgram.js 0.1.5), while saturation and lightness are ignored. To get the corresponding result in colorgram.py, simply do:

.. code:: python

    colors.sort(key=lambda c: c.hsl.h)
    # or...
    sorted(colors, key=lambda c: c.hsl.h)
